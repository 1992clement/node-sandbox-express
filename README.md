# Testing Socket.io

Little todolist project to fiddle with nodeJS and Express.

## Installation :
```
  git clone https://github.com/1992clement/node-sandbox2.git
  cd node-sandbox2
  npm install
  docker-compose up -d
```

## Problem encountered :
Encountered a problem : can't access the route '/done/0' or '/done/1' in chrome only. Somehow, opening the console panel fixes the problem... Couldn't find the origin of the problem nor a workaround for now.
